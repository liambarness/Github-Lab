# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Discord Scraper Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A bot that scrapes messages and images from one discord server and posts them in another.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My python bot will scrape and store messages sent within a discord text channel, and save them then paste them in a nicely formatted manner into another discord text channel. I hope to format the chat in a way so that it looks as if it is the text channel it is mimicking. This will seemingly be the hardest part. I believe I will be able to program this in python and host the bot on google cloud or AWS.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be that the bot scrapes messages, and sends the messages to the directed channel.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for the project would be the bot being capable of displaying the user's name that sent the messages in a clean way, and mimic their profile picture as well. I'd also like it to properly scrape images.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome for my final project is very similar the better outcome, but the best possible outcome before the deadline involves a way to easily integrate and start scraping new channels. Basically being able to easily scale and create more instances of scrapers if need be.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In order to accomplish and complete this project successfully, I will need to further my understanding of how discord bots work, and how they operate and are programmed. I expect to be able to program my bot in python, which will help with me not having to learn a new language. Apart from learning about discord bots themselves, I'll also need to learn how to maintain and keep my bot online so it can continuously scrape messages.
